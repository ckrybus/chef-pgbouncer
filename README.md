Description
===========

This cookbook installs and configures pgbouncer on a ubuntu/debian system.


Requirements
============

## Cookbooks:

This cookbook doesn't have direct dependencies on other cookbooks. Depending on your OS configuration and security policy, you may need additional recipes or cookbooks for this cookbook's recipes to converge on the node. In particular, the following Operating System nuances may affect the behavior:

* apt cache outdated

On Ubuntu/Debian, use Opscode's `apt` cookbook to ensure the package cache is updated so Chef can install packages, or consider putting apt-get in your bootstrap process or [knife bootstrap template](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Knife+Bootstrap).

## Platforms:

Tested on Ubuntu 10.04. Uses the pgbouncer init script.

* Debian
* Ubuntu

Usage
=====

Using this cookbook is pretty straightforward. Add the desired recipes to the 
run list of a node, or create a role. Adjust any attributes as desired. 
For example, to create a basic connection pooler role for PostgreSQL databases:

    % cat roles/connection_pooler.rb
    name "connection pooler"
    description "Lightweight connection pooler for PostgreSQL."
    run_list("recipe[pgbouncer]")
    override_attributes(
      "pgbouncer" => {
        "databases" => {
          "pgbouncer_db_name1" => "host=127.0.0.1 port=5432 dbname=postgres_db_name1",
          "pgbouncer_db_name2" => "host=127.0.0.1 port=5432 dbname=postgres_db_name2"
        },
        "userlist" => {
          "username1" => "secret_password1",
          "username2" => "secret_password2"
        }
      }
    )
